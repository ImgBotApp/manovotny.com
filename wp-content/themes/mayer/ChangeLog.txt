## 1.2.0  ( 11 March 2014 )

## 1.0.0  ( 31 Janaury 2014 )

* Updating the package name generation as per Sass.

* Making sure the JavaScript dependencies are prefixed with 'mayer-'

* Updating the functions and styles to import an additional font weight for Nunito

* Updating package names for the editor style sheet

* Updating the tagline in the style sheet for describing the theme.

* Licensing
	* All third-party assets (scripts, fonts, images, etc) need to have explicit licensing info included in the theme. The scripts already have this in their header, so we just need to deal with Font Awesome.

* Footer
	* WP.com themes need to use this code in footer.php for the credits. Of course, do what you like with the separator.

*  Google Fonts
	* Google Fonts need to be enqueued in a way that allows translators to turn them off (sometimes necessary if a certain font doesn't support a language's special characters).
	* We also need to include code that defeats Google Font enqueueing if the user has active Custom Fonts. This can go in inc/wpcom.php, which is enqueued automatically on WP.com if it exists

* minor cleanup and fixes
	* Remove the RSS feed icon.
	* Replace screenshot.png with a realistic representation of the theme (do not include any branding in the screenshot). 880px x 660px.
	* i18n for includes/helpers.php, L124.
	* partials/no-content.php L9 should use _e
	* Replace all @package WordPress with @package Mayer (and remove @subpackages)
	* Remove .gitignore.
	* i18n for date.php L27
	* Prefix all enqueue style and scripts handles with 'mayer-'
	* We're missing the $themecolors array, which can go in inc/wpcom.php so it's enqueued automatically:
	* Moved all files previous in 'includes' into 'inc'

* Properly escaping values and URLs throughout the theme.
	* esc_url for partials/attachment-pagination.php L15
	* esc_url on the href for partials/avatar.php L3
	* esc_url on the href for partials/post-meta.php L14
	* esc_url on the href for partials/title.php L5
	* esc_url on the href for footer.php L29
	* esc_url and esc_html for the sprintf parameters in functions.php L335
	* esc_attr for the email href in header.php L43
	* esc_attr for the value attribute in searchform.php L18
